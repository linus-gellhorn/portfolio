# Linus' portfolio site

Hello! This will be the home for my personal portfolio.

## To-Do

1.  Create bare-bones content and structure for the website (probably inspired from a template, as showcasing amazing design from scratch isn't a priority for me right now, but I'd still like something relatively nice out of the box)
2.  Use GitHub API to create contributions heatmap
3.  Add UseSound for a bit of fun interactivity
4.  Add Spotify API to display music I'm listening to
5.  Add some cool Three.js 3d models if possible
